In this project, I present a short tutorial for data analysis using Pandas DataFrame.

The data used in this tutorial (country-data.csv) represents a dataset of 160 countries with more than 40 characteristics. The dataset is obtained from the following website: https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets
